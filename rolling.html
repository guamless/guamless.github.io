<!-- l. 208 --><p class='noindent'>“Which Servant should I roll?” is the basic question every <a href='#glo_fgo'>Fate Grand Order (FGO)</a> player asks
themselves. The answer is deceptively simple: the ones you like or the ones with good gameplay.
No one can make this decision for you, but this guide will attempt to give more information to
inform aspiring Masters’ decisions. Little time will be spent discussing individual combat
mechanics and Servants.
</p>
   <h3 class='sectionHead' id='likability'><span class='titlemark'>1.1   </span> <a id='x1-30001.1'></a>Likability</h3>
<!-- l. 212 --><p class='noindent'>Maybe you saw this Servant’s pictures, and that’s why you started <a href='#glo_fgo'>Fate Grand Order (FGO)</a>.
Maybe you fell in love with their story. Regardless, liking a Servant is the ultimate reason to try
to acquire a Servant in <a href='#glo_fgo'>FGO</a>. In a character collection game, collecting you characters you want
is the highest priority, and <a href='#glo_fgo'>FGO</a> is not such a hard game that you can’t afford to disregard
gameplay for love. There are also several ways to boost Servants beyond their peers:
</p>
     <ul class='itemize1'>
     <li class='itemize'><a href='#glo_np'><span class='cmbx-10x-x-109'>Noble Phantasm (NP)</span></a> <span class='cmbx-10x-x-109'>Levels: </span>Additional copies of Servants can be merged to
     provide additional power to a Servant’s <a href='#glo_np'>NP</a>, granting additional damage to the <a href='#glo_np'>NP</a>
     and the potential to Overcharge the <a href='#glo_np'>NP</a> bar of a Servant itself beyond 100%. At Level
     2, a <a href='#glo_np'>NP</a> bar can be filled to 200%, and Level 5 brings 300%. Each <a href='#glo_np'>NP</a> Level brings
     diminishing returns to increasing the scaling damage of a <a href='#glo_np'>NP</a>.
     </li>
     <li class='itemize'><span class='cmbx-10x-x-109'>Fous: </span>There are various forms of Fou used as items in the game. <a href='#glo_paw'>Beast’s Footprints
     (Fou Paws)</a> increase the stats of a specific card in a Servant’s deck, up to +500 Attack
     at 25 used. <a href='#glo_fou'>Hero Crystals (Fous)</a> increase the stats of a Servant across both <a href='#glo_np'>NP</a> and
     cards, divided into <a href='#glo_hp'>Health Points (HP)</a> and Attack. One to three-star <a href='#glo_fou'>Fous</a> cap at
     1000 additional stats, but four-star or “Gold Fous” can be used to further push a
     Servant to 2000 additional stats.
     </li>
     <li class='itemize'><a href='#glo_grailing'><span class='cmbx-10x-x-109'>Palingenesis (Grailing)</span></a><span class='cmbx-10x-x-109'>: </span>Using a <a href='#glo_grail'>Holy Grail</a> on a Servant in <a href='#glo_fgo'>FGO</a> unlocks their
     max level capacity to a higher rung. This allows you to invest further Experience
     and gain even better <a href='#glo_hp'>HP</a> and Attack. Servants can be boosted beyond level 100, but
     require special <a href='#glo_coins'>Servant Coins</a> only acquired in limited numbers through Bond Levels
     and obtaining new Servant copies.

     Attack  damage,  a  Class  target-specific  boost,  and  20%  starting  <a href='#glo_np'>NP</a>  Charge.
     Additionally, <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/critical hit damage.png' width='10' /> Critical Hit Damage and a one-time reduction to Skill Cooldown
     will be made available by the 2026 Anniversary Event of <a href='#glo_fgo'>FGO</a> Global.

     <li class='itemize'><span class='cmbx-10x-x-109'>Class Score: </span>A late game mechanism unlocked after Lostbelt 7 of Part 2 Story that
     enables unlocking a tree of small buffs to a selected Servant class. <span class='cmti-10x-x-109'>Signs </span>on the score
     are gated by a special dust material that can only be farmed three times a day and
     a variety of Torches, unlocked with Story milestones, that unlock specific tree paths.

     <li class='itemize'><span class='cmbx-10x-x-109'>Grand Graph: </span>A system slated for release in <a href='#glo_fgo'>FGO</a> Global in 2027 where Masters

     1000 in <a href='#glo_hp'>HP</a> and Attack, among other effects that can be unlocked like Class Score for
     specific fights. Only one Servant in each of the classes can be Grand, except for the
     Extra classes which have an additional restriction. Only two Servants from the Extra
     group  of  <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/shielder.png' width='10' /> Shielder,  <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/ruler.png' width='10' /> Ruler,  <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/avenger.png' width='10' /> Avenger,  <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/moon cancer.png' width='10' /> Moon  Cancer,  <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/alter ego.png' width='10' /> Alter

<!-- l. 222 --><p class='indent'>   While all of these methods require the use of limited resources, they allow you to massively
boost the performance of your dream Servant. <a href='#glo_fgo'>FGO</a> is an easy game the vast majority of the
time, so savvy Masters will be able to solve all their problems with just a handful of four- and
five-star Servants.

   <h3 class='sectionHead' id='gameplay'><span class='titlemark'>1.2   </span> <a id='x1-40001.2'></a>Gameplay</h3>
<!-- l. 226 --><p class='noindent'>Of course, it’s undeniable that love can only get you so far in terms of performance. However,
gameplay performance is a complicated beast involving interactions between dozens of
different common buff types and individual stage mechanics. Rather than explore
the mathematics behind various damage numbers and <a href='#glo_np'>Noble Phantasm (NP)</a> Charge
points, this guide will instead approach from the opposite direction of discussing what
different kinds of gameplay are present in <a href='#glo_fgo'>Fate Grand Order (FGO)</a> and decisions are
required.

   <h4 class='subsectionHead' id='farming'><span class='titlemark'>1.2.1   </span> <a id='x1-50001.2.1'></a>Farming</h4>
<!-- l. 229 --><p class='noindent'>Nearly everything in <a href='#glo_fgo'>Fate Grand Order (FGO)</a> involves the spending or acquisition of resources.
Farming converts the most basic resource, <a href='#glo_ap'>Action Point (AP)</a> or time, into nearly every other
kind of material, whether that be <a href='#glo_qp'>Quantum Piece (QP)</a> as the basic currency, Servant Experience
for leveling, or <a href='#glo_ascmat'>Ascension Materials</a> that are used in <a href='#glo_ascension'>Ascension</a>, Skill leveling, and even unlocking
<a href='#glo_costume'>Spiritron Dresses (Costumes)</a>. As such, the vast majority of playtime will be spent in farming of
one kind or another.
</p>
   <h5 class='subsubsectionHead' id='event-free-quests'><a id='x1-6000'></a>Event Free Quests</h5>
<!-- l. 231 --><p class='noindent'>This is the most common form of farming encountered. Event <a href='#glo_fq'>Free Quests (FQs)</a> are nodes that
become available for repeated clears through completion of Event Story that remain open until
the end of the Event. Each node has a ramping difficulty rating marked by a suggested Level
rating, within the range of Level 20 to 90++. Nearly all Event <a href='#glo_fq'>FQs</a> feature three waves.
Typically, <a href='#glo_fq'>FQs</a> offer a chance to obtain at least two <a href='#glo_ascmat'>Ascension Materials</a> and some class
appropriate <a href='#glo_piece'>Pieces and Monuments</a>, but the primary reason they make up the bulk of <a href='#glo_fgo'>Fate
Grand Order (FGO)</a> farming are the Event materials they offer. Nearly every Event features a
Shop where Masters can exchange gold, silver, and bronze Event Shop currency for
a variety of products, including valuable <a href='#glo_lore'>Crystallized Lores (Lores)</a>, <a href='#glo_coins'>Servant Coins</a>
for the Event Reward Servant, Servant Experience cards, <a href='#glo_fou'>Hero Crystals (Fous)</a>, the
frustrating-to-farm <a href='#glo_piece'>Pieces and Monuments</a>, and normal <a href='#glo_ascmat'>Ascension Materials</a>. Event <a href='#glo_fq'>FQs</a> offer
these Event materials in different combinations, with increasing returns the higher the
node difficulty rating. This means that Masters, when farming Event <a href='#glo_fq'>FQs</a>, can farm
effectively five different items simultaneously, until the Event Shop has been exhausted that
is.
</p><!-- l. 233 --><p class='indent'>   Farming Event <a href='#glo_fq'>FQs</a> are made somewhat easier by the presence of a Damage Bonus to specific
Servants in most Events. However, Event <a href='#glo_fq'>FQs</a> have one significant restriction: <a href='#glo_ce'>Craft Essences
(CEs)</a>. Event currency drops in as a number of small stacks, but each stack can typically be
boosted in size with an Event <a href='#glo_ce'>CEs</a> corresponding to the appropriate currency. These <a href='#glo_ce'>CEs</a> can be
acquired from Event banners, as well as one three-star copy for bronze given for free in an
early Story node. Further, events will occasionally feature a secondary set of three
materials for advancing through the story, along with one more free five-star <a href='#glo_ce'>CEs</a>. Event
Reward <a href='#glo_ce'>CEs</a> nearly always have a tiny chance to drop an additional copy from the
<a href='#glo_fq'>FQs</a> of the same event. All of these <a href='#glo_ce'>CEs</a> mean Masters can feature heavy restrictions
with regards to <a href='#glo_cost'>Party Cost</a> and <a href='#glo_ce'>CEs</a>, as efficient use of <a href='#glo_ap'>Action Points (APs)</a> means
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
bringing as many of the appropriate bonus drop Event <a href='#glo_ce'>CEs</a> as possible. Finally, some
events feature a “damage” <a href='#glo_ce'>CE</a>, a five-star <a href='#glo_ce'>CEs</a> that gives a huge buff, but only for the
event, alongside the normal extra effect. While this sounds like a benefit, in reality the
event will scale fights with the assumption that the damage <a href='#glo_ce'>CE</a> is used, adding yet
another <a href='#glo_ce'>CE</a> to a Master’s Party that may not feature the effects or starting charge
desired.
</p>
   <h5 class='subsubsectionHead' id='raids'><a id='x1-7000'></a>Raids</h5>
<!-- l. 235 --><p class='noindent'>Raids are a special form of <a href='#glo_fq'>Free Quest (FQ)</a> where Masters are typically pitted against an
extremely high <a href='#glo_hp'>Health Points (HP)</a> single wave. Although most often featured as part of an
Event, they occasionally appear in Main Story. This fight has a restriction that it can
only be cleared a certain number of times cumulatively by all Masters before it is
vanquished, typically followed by a single clear Story version of the same Raid fight. With
above average rewards, such as additional <a href='#glo_ascmat'>Ascension Materials</a> beyond the usual two
and <a href='#glo_qp'>Quantum Pieces (QPs)</a>, Raids are highly lucrative. However, their time-sensitive
nature forces the use of <a href='#glo_ap_gls'>Action Points</a> replenishing items for serious farming. Therefore,
Masters will have to evaluate whether a given Raid offers the best return for time and
energy.
</p>
   <h5 class='subsubsectionHead' id='lottery-event-free-quests'><a id='x1-8000'></a>Lottery Event Free Quests</h5>
<!-- l. 237 --><p class='noindent'>Lottery Event <a href='#glo_fq'>Free Quests (FQs)</a> are identical with normal Event <a href='#glo_fq'>FQs</a> with a few key differences.
Lottery Events always feature a secondary material called a Lottery Ticket that drops from all
Event <a href='#glo_fq'>FQs</a>, with the usual Event Reward <a href='#glo_ce'>Craft Essences (CEs)</a> boosting its drop rate and
dropping with a small chance from those same <a href='#glo_fq'>FQs</a>. These Tickets are used to draw
from boxes of 300 items at a rate of 2 tickets per draw. When the pool of 300 items is
exhausted, it is replaced by a fresh set of 300. This means Lottery Events <a href='#glo_fq'>FQs</a> not only
offer the same rewards as a typical Event <a href='#glo_fq'>FQs</a>, but also whatever is offered within the
Lottery boxes. All Lottery Events feature at least <a href='#glo_fp'>Friend Points (FP)</a>, <a href='#glo_qp'>Quantum Pieces
(QPs)</a>, three- and four-star Servant Experience, <a href='#glo_gem'>Skill Gems</a> of every class and rarity,
three Bronze Apples to replenish <a href='#glo_ap'>Action Points (APs)</a>, Mana Prisms, and five different
<a href='#glo_ascmat'>Ascension Materials</a>. Almost always the most lucrative farming opportunities of the year,
Lottery Events historically run twice a year, with the first Lottery Event of the year
featuring a rotation of <a href='#glo_fq'>FQs</a> every few days called a Round. Many Masters strive to find
the fastest and most stable Parties to clear their desired Quests and fill their Party
entirely with the five-star Lottery Ticket <a href='#glo_ce'>CEs</a>, Limit Breaking as they gain more copies.
Therefore, <a href='#glo_cost'>Party Cost</a> and <a href='#glo_ce'>CE</a> flexibility is never at more of a premium than a Lottery

   <h5 class='subsubsectionHead' id='story-free-quests'><a id='x1-9000'></a>Story Free Quests</h5>
<!-- l. 239 --><p class='noindent'>In many ways, Story <a href='#glo_fq'>Free Quests (FQs)</a> are the opposite in every way of Event <a href='#glo_fq'>FQs</a>. They are
permanently available once a Master clears their respective Main Story chapter, their rewards are
not typically as lucrative, the choice of <a href='#glo_ce'>Craft Essences (CEs)</a> is not influenced by special Event
drops, and they are much easier to clear, with the best <a href='#glo_fq'>FQs</a> sometimes having a relatively low

<!-- l. 241 --><p class='noindent'>Daily Quests are a section of Chaldea Gate featuring a set of quests where Masters can
farm either Servant materials, Servant Experience, or <a href='#glo_qp'>Quantum Pieces (QPs)</a>. Ember
Gathering quests reward nine Servant Experience embers, randomly distributed between
two Servant Classes and <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/berserker.png' width='10' /> Berserker. Training Ground quests rotate daily and
provide <a href='#glo_piece'>Pieces and Monuments</a> and <a href='#glo_gem'>Skill Gems</a> for a specific Servant Class. Both Ember
Gathering and Training Ground quests reward higher difficulty version clears with an
increased chance at the higher rarity versions of those materials, with the Extreme
Level 60 Ember Gathering quests guaranteeing 9 highest rarity Servant Experience
embers. Finally, Treasure Vault quests are permanently available without rotation,
providing large amounts of <a href='#glo_qp'>QP</a> and nothing else. Overall, Daily Quests are generally very
permissive with Party composition, although higher levels of Training Ground quests can be
somewhat challenging for new Masters because they feature random shadow Servants
of that class. However, efficiently farming the Treasure Vault quests means filling a
Party with the appropriate <a href='#glo_qp'>QP</a> bonus-providing <a href='#glo_ce'>Craft Essences (CEs)</a>, which are all

little-to-no decision making at all. However, there are certain unique challenges that some story
fights provide: Forced Supports.

more <a href='#glo_cost'>Party Cost</a> for <a href='#glo_ce'>Craft Essences (CEs)</a> but removing space for Servants. However,
removing the choice of Friend Support nearly always is a challenge for Masters who are

   <h4 class='subsectionHead' id='teambuilding'><span class='titlemark'>1.2.3   </span> <a id='x1-210001.2.3'></a>Teambuilding</h4>
<!-- l. 265 --><p class='noindent'>Once a Master understands the type of fight they will enter, they can begin the most important
stage of any <a href='#glo_fgo'>Fate Grand Order (FGO)</a> battle: teambuilding. The most common approach to any
fight is picking a single strong damage dealer Servant with an appropriate Servant Class for the
fight, picking Area-of-Effect or Single-Target <a href='#glo_np'>Noble Phantasm (NP)</a> based on the number of
enemies expected. The rest of the Party then concentrates on offering further support to that
designated damage dealer. In farming, the vast majority of nodes feature three waves
of enemies, and Masters should create a plan that allows three rapid <a href='#glo_np'>NPs</a> from the
damage dealer while preserving damage effects for the last wave. Challenge fights are less
rigid, but in return will present unexpected challenges. Masters can guess at whether a
challenge fight has multiple enemies by checking the name of the fight’s node, the
number of Servant Classes present in the fight, and by checking the hint displayed
when entering the Party selection screen, if any. These hints can assist Masters to pick
appropriate supportive Servants that can counter effects like <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/invincible.png' width='10' /> Invincible or <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/ignore invincible.png' width='10' /> Ignore
Invincible. With time and experience, Masters will learn more sophisticated teambuilding
strategies, such as using a second, weaker damage dealer to handle one of the three waves
in farming when <a href='#glo_np'>NP</a> Charge is unavailable for a single damage dealer. Effects like
<img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/guts.png' width='10' /> Guts and <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/target focus.png' width='10' /> Target Focus enable unique strategies for challenge fights. However,
teambuilding is a skill that can always be improved, with time, effort, and observing other
Masters.

<!-- l. 267 --><p class='noindent'>With so many different forms of gameplay, options, and strategies, what conclusions can be
drawn about what makes a Servant useful in <a href='#glo_fgo'>Fate Grand Order (FGO)</a>? There are three
guidelines for Servant performance. Evaluating and weighing them is up to individual
Masters.
</p>
   <h5 class='subsubsectionHead' id='charge-is-king'><a id='x1-23000'></a>Charge is King</h5>
<!-- l. 269 --><p class='noindent'>From the very earliest days of <a href='#glo_fgo'>Fate Grand Order (FGO)</a>, the <a href='#glo_np'>Noble Phantasm (NP)</a> was the
preferred way to deal damage. Normal cards do not do enough damage, and even <a href='#glo_crit'>Critical Hits
(crits)</a> are subject to the shuffle of the cards each turn. The only way to do big, consistent
damage, whether over three turns to clear most farming content, or over a sustained period in a
<a href='#glo_cq'>Challenge Quest (CQ)</a>, is with a <a href='#glo_np'>NP</a>. Thus, making the <a href='#glo_np'>NP</a> as easy to reuse as possible is a core
element of nearly every effective Party design. <a href='#glo_np'>NP</a> Charge is critical at all levels: the more charge
a Servant has within its kit, the less reliant it is on <a href='#glo_ce'>Craft Essences (CEs)</a> with starting charge to
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
deal damage on demand. For example, a Servant with enough <a href='#glo_np'>NP</a> Charge to start at
full can use any Event Damage <a href='#glo_ce'>CE</a> without requiring external support for the first
turn. By contrast, 50% <a href='#glo_np'>NP</a> Charge Servants frequently want a matching 50% <a href='#glo_np'>NP</a>
Charge <a href='#glo_ce'>CE</a>, which might take up space from an Event <a href='#glo_ce'>CE</a>. A Servant with only 30%
<a href='#glo_np'>NP</a> Charge will almost certainly require unlocking and upgrading the 2nd <a href='#glo_append'>Append
Skill</a> for an additional 20% starting <a href='#glo_np'>NP</a> Charge. Extremely few Servants considered
good are without <a href='#glo_np'>NP</a> Charge, and those mostly have an equivalent means of reaching
their <a href='#glo_np'>NP</a> like <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/arts.png' width='15' /> Arts <a href='#glo_crit'>crits</a> or an <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/arts.png' width='15' /> Arts <a href='#glo_np'>NP</a> that “refunds” much of the bar on
use.

<!-- l. 271 --><p class='noindent'><a href='#glo_np'>Noble Phantasm (NP)</a> Charge isn’t everything. Some Servants have no issues reaching their <a href='#glo_np'>NP</a>
but cannot utilize that <a href='#glo_np'>NP</a> to actually impact the fight. Of course, not every Servant is intended
to do damage themselves. However, every Servant should contribute in some way to dealing

As this guide seeks to avoid a discussion of numbers, discussing damage can be challenging.
However, the following are some short tips to finding damage in a Servant’s kit: </p>
     <ul class='itemize1'>
     <li class='itemize'><span class='cmbx-10x-x-109'>Special Attack: </span>Many modern Servants possess special damage abilities that read
     something like “Special Attack damage to all enemies with [Earth Powers].” These
     effects greatly increase the damage of a <a href='#glo_np'>NP</a>, although only against certain targets.
     While this doesn’t make the Servant more effective into all nodes, it does give Masters
     the flexibility to plan and pick specific farming opportunities based on these bonuses.
     </li>
     <li class='itemize'><span class='cmbx-10x-x-109'>Big Numbers: </span>If the numbers in Attack or offensive buffs of a Servant compared
     to the competition is higher, than the Servant’s performance might be higher than
     the competition. If it has higher damage scaling on the <a href='#glo_np'>NP</a> or a specific Master has
     acquired more <a href='#glo_np'>NP</a> Levels, the Servant will outperform the competition.
     </li>
     <li class='itemize'><span class='cmbx-10x-x-109'>Variety: </span>Some of the buffs in <a href='#glo_fgo'>Fate Grand Order (FGO)</a> combine additively, while
     others are multiplicative. For that reason, a Servant with offensive strength spread
     into a variety of buffs that effect the <a href='#glo_np'>NP</a> is likely to have a strong <a href='#glo_np'>NP</a>.
     </li>
     <li class='itemize'><span class='cmbx-10x-x-109'>Critical Hits and Stars: </span>Servants that have huge amounts of <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/critical hit damage.png' width='10' /> Critical Hit
     Damage,  to  the  order  of  100%  or  lower  numbers  with  two  or  three  <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/buster.png' width='15' /> Buster
     cards can likely deal tremendous damage with <a href='#glo_crit'>Critical Hits (crits)</a>. Combined with
     <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/stars.png' width='10' /> Stars and <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/star gather up.png' width='10' /> Star Gather Up, a Servant will be able to do almost as much
     damage as their <a href='#glo_np'>NP</a> or even better. Many Masters do not want to rely on <a href='#glo_crit'>crits</a> for
     farming, but for challenge content and slow farming, <a href='#glo_crit'>crits</a> can be a significant or only
     source of damage.
     </li>
     <li class='itemize'><span class='cmbx-10x-x-109'>Community Reception: </span>The <a href='#glo_fgo'>FGO</a> community, like any conglomerate of Internet
     users,  is  a  mess  of  conflicting  opinions  and  incorrect  information.  Regardless,
     community reception is a decent litmus test for a Servant’s performance in damage.
     This guide trusts you are able to find your own way.</li></ul>
   <h5 class='subsubsectionHead' id='utility-is-damage-sometimes'><a id='x1-25000'></a>Utility is Damage, Sometimes</h5>
<!-- l. 280 --><p class='noindent'>For any game involving a Party, decisions are all about give and take. Give a damage
dealer a supportive Servant that offers <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/ignore invincible.png' width='10' /> Ignore Invincible and now they lose the
opportunity to receive the damage boost from a supportive Servant that offers higher
amplification but no <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/ignore invincible.png' width='10' /> Ignore Invincible. A <a href='#glo_ce'>Craft Essence (CE)</a> that gives a huge
amount of <a href='#glo_np'>Noble Phantasm (NP)</a> Charge excludes that Servant from using a <a href='#glo_ce'>CE</a> that
boosts purely damage. For that reason, utility tools in a Servant’s kit like <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/ignore invincible.png' width='10' /> Ignore
Invincible, Debuff Removal, <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/buff removal resistance.png' width='10' /> Buff Removal Resistance, and <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/evade.png' width='10' /> Evade can substitute
for damage in challenging fights that involve those effects. However, there is a cost.
Servants that feature many utility tools often trade real damage for these effects, and
utility kits rarely have anything to offer for farming. Many Masters have taken to
rolling Servants that focus purely on damage with the idea that supportive Servants
can be used to shore them up for Challenge fights. However, only the best players
(and the biggest spenders) will be able to fully work around a damage-only Servant
skillset. The best Servants in the game feature both strong utility and significant damage
capability.

buff before cleansing all Party debuffs as well. Finally, each level of <a href='#glo_overcharge'>Noble Phantasm
Overcharge (Overcharge)</a> she receives she returns to the entire Party as an additional
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
instance of protection with <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/anti enforcement defense.png' width='10' /> Anti Enforcement Defense, a nearly impenetrable
defensive buff that negates received attack damage. Her <a href='#glo_np'>NP</a>, <a href='#glo_np'>NP</a> Charge support,
and offensive buffs are so strong that Castoria is worth using even with <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/buster.png' width='15' /> Buster
and <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/quick.png' width='17' /> Quick Servants. Castoria does not heal the Party, provide <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/stars.png' width='10' /> Stars, or
<img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/critical hit damage.png' width='10' /> Critical Hit Damage. Regardless, for nearly any <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/arts.png' width='15' /> Arts team she can be the glue.
However, what Castoria provides outside of her <a href='#glo_np'>NP</a> is somewhat replaceable, with even
three-star Xu Fu (<img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/alter ego.png' width='10' /> Alter Ego) doing a great job and available in the Friend Point
Summon. Masters that don’t decide to roll their own should consider taking her from
Friend Support when using <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/arts.png' width='15' /> Arts Servants or facing bosses with extreme damage
output.

<!-- l. 292 --><p class='noindent'>Scáthach-Skadi (<img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/caster.png' width='10' /> Caster) is the one true savior of <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/quick.png' width='17' /> Quick. When she returned for her
summer appearance, she was still the one true savior of <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/quick.png' width='17' /> Quick that is also a <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/ruler.png' width='10' /> Ruler.
Both forms of Skadi have similar characteristics: targeted 50% <a href='#glo_np'>Noble Phantasm (NP)</a> Charge and
50% <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/quick.png' width='17' /> Quick buff. The two function similarly in farming, but differentiate themselves outside
of farming. While the original <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/caster.png' width='10' /> Caster form provides 100% <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/quick.png' width='17' /> Quick <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/critical hit damage.png' width='10' /> Critical Hit
Damage and an enemy Party-wide <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/defense down.png' width='10' /> Defense Down, the summer <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/ruler.png' width='10' /> Ruler form instead
gives 100% <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/buster.png' width='15' /> Buster <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/critical hit damage.png' width='10' /> Critical Hit Damage and a small amount of <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/attack up.png' width='10' /> Attack Up,
<img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/quick.png' width='17' /> Quick, and <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/buster.png' width='15' /> Buster to the whole Party, as well as <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/stars.png' width='10' /> Stars, <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/stars per turn.png' width='10' /> Stars Per Turn, and
<img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/buster.png' width='15' /> Buster <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/star gather up.png' width='10' /> Star Gather Up. While this may appear a strange set of effects for a
<img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/quick.png' width='17' /> Quick support, <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/quick.png' width='17' /> Quick Servants more than any other rely on their whole deck to
deal damage through <a href='#glo_crit'>Critical Hits (crits)</a> and regain their <a href='#glo_np'>NP</a>. Because <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/buster.png' width='15' /> Buster
cards have bigger starting modifiers, they deal more damage than equivalent <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/arts.png' width='15' /> Arts
and <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/quick.png' width='17' /> Quick cards when they perform a <a href='#glo_crit'>crit</a>. It also means that Skadi Summer
(<img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/ruler.png' width='10' /> Ruler) can function somewhat as a <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/buster.png' width='15' /> Buster support outside of farming. The two
Skadis have completely different <a href='#glo_np'>NPs</a>. Skadi (<img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/caster.png' width='10' /> Caster) features a non-damaging
<a href='#glo_np'>NP</a> that grants the Party a one-time <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/evade.png' width='10' /> Evade, <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/attack up.png' width='10' /> Attack Up, and significant
<img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/critical hit damage.png' width='10' /> Critical Hit Damage for five turns. Skadi Summer (<img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/ruler.png' width='10' /> Ruler) instead trades the
additional support for an Area-of-Effect <a href='#glo_np'>NP</a> that deals significant extra damage to
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
enemies of the Lawful alignment while also draining all enemy <a href='#glo_np'>NP</a> Charge bars by one
stage. This means that Skadi Summer (<img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/ruler.png' width='10' /> Ruler) can also function as a farming
damage dealer and generalist. The two Skadis function both as excellent Servants
themselves while also having synergy with each other. In summary, Skadi Summer
(<img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/ruler.png' width='10' /> Ruler) has the better supporting skills while Skadi (<img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/caster.png' width='10' /> Caster) also features a potent
supportive <a href='#glo_np'>NP</a>, although that <a href='#glo_np'>NP</a> will require additional support to reach. Masters will
find farming with <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/quick.png' width='17' /> Quick Servants to be a challenge without any Skadi of their
own.

(<img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/foreigner.png' width='10' /> Foreigner), is a Servant designed purely for <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/buster.png' width='15' /> Buster. Masters who have used
<img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/buster.png' width='15' /> Buster Servants for some time will notice that <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/buster.png' width='15' /> Buster Servants, of all the
card types, are most reliant on skills. After all, <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/quick.png' width='17' /> Quick generates <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/stars.png' width='10' /> Stars for
<a href='#glo_crit'>Critical Hits (crits)</a> and <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/arts.png' width='15' /> Arts generates <a href='#glo_np'>Noble Phantasm (NP)</a> Charge for a <a href='#glo_np'>NP</a>, but
<img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/buster.png' width='15' /> Buster can only offer card damage; it needs additional assistance to achieve what
the other two card types receive automatically. Koyanskaya features extreme buffs to
<img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/buster.png' width='15' /> Buster, <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/buster.png' width='15' /> Buster <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/critical hit damage.png' width='10' /> Critical Hit Damage, <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/buster.png' width='15' /> Buster <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/star gather up.png' width='10' /> Star Gather Up,
dumps 20 <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/stars.png' width='10' /> Stars, and even features two Special Attack bonuses, all for a single
targeted Servant. However, Koyanskaya of Light’s (<img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/assassin.png' width='10' /> Assassin) greatest trick is
a two turn Skill Cooldown reduction on her targetable 50% <a href='#glo_np'>NP</a> Charge. With two
Koyanskaya, a Servant gets a whopping 4 turns of Skill Cooldown reduction, enough to
potentially double skill effects, effectively doubling any <a href='#glo_np'>NP</a> Charge in a Servant’s kit,
and at the very least quickly reuse a powerful defensive effect. Combined with a 10%
<a href='#glo_np'>NP</a> Charge per normal Buster card used, and Koyanskaya is able shore up many of
<img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/buster.png' width='15' /> Buster’s weaknesses at once. However, her damaging Area-of-Effect <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/buster.png' width='15' /> Buster
<a href='#glo_np'>NP</a> has no supportive or utility effects beyond an Area <a href='#glo_np'>NP</a> Charge Bar drain, and
Koyanskaya drains the entire Party’s health by 1000 with each use of her <a href='#glo_np'>NP</a> Charge skill.
Although the two cooldown reduction on a skill is truly unique, Koyanskaya of Light
(<img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/assassin.png' width='10' /> Assassin) faces some competition with other supports that provide different spreads
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
of buffs to <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/buster.png' width='15' /> Buster Servants without fully committing to one card type. As an
<img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/assassin.png' width='10' /> Assassin damage dealer herself, she ironically suffers slightly from being unable to
benefit from two Party member Koyanskayas where other <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/buster.png' width='15' /> Buster <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/assassin.png' width='10' /> Assassins
can.

Oberon (<img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/pretender.png' width='10' /> Pretender)! Compared to the previous honorable mentions, Oberon possesses less
tricks: four to be exact. Firstly, <a href='#glo_np'>Noble Phantasm (NP)</a> Charge spread 20% across the
Party and 50% to a single Servant, for a whopping 70% to a single Party member,
with the caveat of a 20% <a href='#glo_np'>NP</a> Charge at the beginning of the next turn. Second, an
instant 20 <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/stars.png' width='10' /> Stars. Third, extreme <a href='#glo_np'>NP</a> buffs with 20% <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/NP strength up.png' width='10' /> NP Strength Up to
the whole Party and an additional 2 times multiplier to <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/NP strength up.png' width='10' /> NP Strength Up and
<img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/buster.png' width='15' /> Buster, with the caveat that after the that turn the targeted Servant is left permanently
asleep and completely unusable with no counterplay or ability to move the Servant out
of the frontline. Thankfully, the Servant also loses all buffs and debuffs and gains a
three turn <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/target focus.png' width='10' /> Target Focus that will distract the enemy and also hopefully result
in the Servant’s swift defeat so that the Party isn’t stuck with only two members
active for the remainder of the fight. Finally, Oberon’s Area-of-Effect <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/buster.png' width='15' /> Buster
<a href='#glo_np'>NP</a> not only deals damage, but also puts enemies to <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/sleep.png' width='10' /> Sleep and <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/invincible.png' width='10' /> Invincible
for one turn. This gives Oberon the ability to stall the enemy for a turn and then
protect the enemy for a turn from being waken up from <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/sleep.png' width='10' /> Sleep from receiving an
attack. Overall Oberon (<img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/pretender.png' width='10' /> Pretender) provides massive <a href='#glo_np'>NP</a> Charge and damage
amplification for any Servant with <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/NP strength up.png' width='10' /> NP Strength Up buffs or <a href='#glo_ce'>Craft Essences (CEs)</a>,
but features little utility and consistent damage support in exchange. He operates
very well in farming where the end of the fight is planned or as a backline last ditch
option.

interchangeable Servants, but their differences have expanded with time. Both Servants can give
a total of 50% charge to a single Servant, but while Zhuge Liang breaks that <a href='#glo_np'>Noble Phantasm
(NP)</a> Charge into 20% for the Party and 30% for a single target, Sima Yi gives 10% to the Party
and two separate targeted 20% <a href='#glo_np'>NP</a> Charges. This trades a bit more charge overall for a higher
potential threshold of 30% for two Servants. Both offer <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/attack up.png' width='10' /> Attack Up, Zhuge Liang to the
Party but Sima Yi at higher numbers to a single target. Both offer the potent combination of
<img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/defense up.png' width='10' /> Defense Up and <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/damage cut.png' width='10' /> Damage Cut to the entire Party, mitigating a significant amount of
damage for three turns. However, from here the two Servants diverge. Zhuge Liang features
<img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/critical hit damage.png' width='10' /> Critical Hit Damage, <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/NP strength up.png' width='10' /> NP Strength Up, and two stages of <a href='#glo_overcharge'>Noble Phantasm
Overcharge (Overcharge)</a> to a single Servant, although the later will only release in 2027
in <a href='#glo_fgo'>Fate Grand Order (FGO)</a> Global after 10th Anniversary. His non-damaging <a href='#glo_np'>NP</a>
inflicts a variety of debilitating effects on the enemy formation, including a chance to
<img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/stun.png' width='10' /> Stun, <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/defense down.png' width='10' /> Defense Down, and <a href='#glo_np'>NP</a> Charge drain. By contrast, Sima Yi, as a
<img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/rider.png' width='10' /> Rider, has a tendency to actively steal <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/stars.png' width='10' /> Stars from her Party members with a
higher Star Weight to her cards, but offers <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/debuff resistance up.png' width='10' /> Debuff Resistance Up and 2 time
<img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/invincible.png' width='10' /> Invincible to a target with her skills. Her non-damaging <a href='#glo_np'>NP</a> focuses on the Party instead,
inflicting the enemy with a <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/defense down.png' width='10' /> Defense Down but also negating the Servant Class
defensive disadvantage, massively boosting <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/NP gain up.png' width='10' /> NP Gain Up, and granting a stage of
<a href='#glo_overcharge'>Overcharge</a> to the entire Party. Overall, both Zhuge Liang (<img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/caster.png' width='10' /> Caster) and Sima Yi
(<img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/rider.png' width='10' /> Rider) offer fantastic support to any Servant in the game, but Zhuge Liang’s
(<img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/caster.png' width='10' /> Caster) damage amplification is greater. Further, Zhuge Liang is a Permanent Servant
and present in the Permanent Five Star Servant Exchange Ticket available to new
Masters. By contrast, Sima Yi can only be rolled from banners that offer her as a Rate
Up.

<!-- l. 308 --><p class='noindent'>Masters with especially good eyes may have noticed a certain absent effect in the honorable mentions
thus far. Never fear, because Merlin (<img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/caster.png' width='10' /> Caster) and Lady Avalon (<img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/pretender.png' width='10' /> Pretender) are here to
provide healing in abundance. The two Merlins extremely similar kits at the core: 20% Party
<a href='#glo_np'>Noble Phantasm (NP)</a> Charge, Party <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/attack up.png' width='10' /> Attack Up, a one turn Party <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/invincible.png' width='10' /> Invincible, and a
targetable 50% card color buff with an additional 100% <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/critical hit damage.png' width='10' /> Critical Hit Damage and 3000
<img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/max HP up.png' width='10' /> Max HP Up. Both feature a <a href='#glo_np'>NP</a> that heals the entire Party, gives the Party <a href='#glo_np'>NP</a> Charge Per
Turn, and generates <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/stars per turn.png' width='10' /> Stars Per Turn scaling with <a href='#glo_overcharge'>Noble Phantasm Overcharge (Overcharge)</a>
stages. The most glaring difference between the two is the card color; Merlin buffs <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/buster.png' width='15' /> Buster
while Lady Avalon buffs <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/arts.png' width='15' /> Arts. The two Merlins also have slightly different healing
methods on their <a href='#glo_np'>NP</a>, with Merlin offering <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/HP recovery per turn.png' width='10' /> HP Recovery Per Turn and Lady Avalon
equivalent <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/max HP up.png' width='10' /> Max HP Up. Merlin’s <a href='#glo_np'>NP</a> Effects also last for five turns where Lady
Avalon’s only last for three, with the exception of the <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/stars per turn.png' width='10' /> Stars Per Turn. While
presently Lady Avalon’s Party <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/invincible.png' width='10' /> Invincible skill has the edge with 20% self <a href='#glo_np'>NP</a>
Charge per enemy and an enemy formation <a href='#glo_np'>NP</a> Charge drain, Merlin will receive a buff
that offers an additional 10% Party <a href='#glo_np'>NP</a> Charge and 50% <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/critical hit damage.png' width='10' /> Critical Hit Damage.
Lady Avalon also has a passive skill granting 20% self <a href='#glo_np'>NP</a> Charge at the start of the
battle. Overall, Merlin (<img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/caster.png' width='10' /> Caster) is the better support for <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/buster.png' width='15' /> Buster Servants,
those that <a href='#glo_crit'>Critical Hit (crit)</a>, and farming in general, but Lady Avalon’s <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/arts.png' width='15' /> Arts
buff, upfront healing, and significant self <a href='#glo_np'>NP</a> Charge positions her well to synergize
with the better support ecosystem of <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/arts.png' width='15' /> Arts and use her <a href='#glo_np'>NP</a> more frequently than
Merlin. However, Masters should be aware that both can provide significant healing to
any team and broadly replace the other. Also, Masters will discover with time that
killing the enemy dead is a more stable and robust strategy than slowly whittling down
a boss. Hans Anderson (<img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/caster.png' width='10' /> Caster) is a two-star Servant available in the Friend
Point Summon that can fulfill a similar role, albeit with more difficulty and far less
stability.

<!-- l. 312 --><p class='noindent'>Unique among any Servant recommended is Ashiya Douman (<img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/alter ego.png' width='10' /> Alter Ego). Douman is a
two-trick pony, and many Masters will find at least one of his tricks worthless. Nonetheless, those
Masters who prefer Servants with certain alignments will find him an excellent addition to the
team. First, Douman’s Area-of-Effect <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/quick.png' width='17' /> Quick <a href='#glo_np'>Noble Phantasm (NP)</a> does not deal
noteworthy damage, and even with high investment can be disappointing. However, it can
leverage one of the more unique systems in <a href='#glo_fgo'>Fate Grand Order (FGO)</a>: Instant Death. Normally,
Instant Death is a relatively useless effect a Servant can offer. The way Instant Death works is
the entirety of a Servant’s Instant Death chance is multiplied against the enemy’s Death Rate in
order to determine the chance of the target’s death. Against the vast majority of enemies, the
resulting chance is so abysmally tiny that even Masters using Instant Death all the
time may fail to see a single instance of an actual Instant Death in months. However,
Ashiya Douman is almost completely unique for offering 120% Instant Death chance
directly on his <a href='#glo_np'>NP</a>. Bronze enemies, especially those in Story, feature significantly less
difficult Death Rate checks than most enemies, and Douman can exploit even an 80%
Death Rate with a 96% chance of success. In any situation where Death Rate can be
exploited, Douman can, at the very least with some extra help from a <a href='#glo_ce'>Craft Essence
(CE)</a> or a <a href='#glo_mc'>Mystic Code (MC)</a>. If Douman combines his 80% self <a href='#glo_np'>NP</a> Charge with the
20% <a href='#glo_np'>NP</a> Charge <a href='#glo_append'>Append Skill</a>, he is able to fully charge this <a href='#glo_np'>NP</a> without external
support. However, Ashiya Douman’s signature trick is offering 20% <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/attack up.png' width='10' /> Attack Up and
50% <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/critical hit damage.png' width='10' /> Critical Hit Damage to any Party members that are either Chaotic or Evil
alignment. The effects stack for Chaotic Evil alignment Servants like himself for a
whopping 40% <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/attack up.png' width='10' /> Attack Up and 100% <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/critical hit damage.png' width='10' /> Critical Hit Damage. On top of this, he can
inflict 30% <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/defense down.png' width='10' /> Defense Down on the enemy formation. Any Master with significant
investment in a Chaotic Evil Servant should consider Ashiya Douman for his ridiculous
damage amplification. However, Ashiya Douman (<img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/alter ego.png' width='10' /> Alter Ego) does not provide <a href='#glo_np'>NP</a>
Charge for the Party and only deals noteworthy damage through <a href='#glo_crit'>Critical Hits (crits)</a>
himself.

<!-- l. 316 --><p class='noindent'>Kazuradrop (<img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/alter ego.png' width='10' /> Alter Ego) is the first of the Servants featured in this guide to be unreleased in
<a href='#glo_fgo'>Fate Grand Order (FGO)</a> Global as of Friday 29<sup class='textsuperscript'><span class='cmr-10'>th</span></sup> August, 2025. Releasing shortly after Summer
2026, Kazuradrop shares more than just a class with Ashiya Douman; both are card-centric
supports that provide no charge. However, Kazuradrop does not feature the same Alignment
restrictions as Douman. Her damage amplification comes entirely from debuffs, with a skill that
boosts her <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/debuff chance up.png' width='10' /> Debuff Chance Up by 30% before placing a 50% <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/quick card resistance down.png' width='10' /> Quick Card Resistance
Down on the current turn for one turn and then again on the following two turns. Few enemies in
the game have a <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/debuff resistance up.png' width='10' /> Debuff Resistance Up of more than 30%, so the practical effect is a
50% <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/quick.png' width='17' /> Quick buff to the Party. She has an additional effect applied at the same
time in <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/critical hit resistance down.png' width='10' /> Critical Hit Resistance Down, which acts as an appropriate card color
buff, but only Servants deal <a href='#glo_crit'>Critical Hits (crits)</a>. Combined with an additional 50%
<img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/defense down.png' width='10' /> Defense Down with another Active Skill, Kazuradrop massively increases cards effects for
either <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/quick.png' width='17' /> Quick or <a href='#glo_crit'>crits</a>, but especially together. Any Servant with an <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/arts.png' width='15' /> Arts
or <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/quick.png' width='17' /> Quick card with <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/stars.png' width='10' /> Stars will see their <a href='#glo_np'>Noble Phantasm (NP)</a> Charge bar
quickly fill with <a href='#glo_crit'>crits</a>. Despite all these strengths, Kazuradrop (<img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/alter ego.png' width='10' /> Alter Ego) is
ruined when either her debuffs fail to land on an enemy or the enemy removes her
beginning-of-turn buff that inflicts the <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/quick card resistance down.png' width='10' /> Quick Card Resistance Down and <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/critical hit resistance down.png' width='10' /> Critical Hit
Resistance Down, making her weak to any form of buff or debuff control. Nonetheless,
Kazuradrop’s damage amplification is incredibly formidable and is not her only trick;
she’s a competent damage dealer. With 50% self <a href='#glo_np'>NP</a> Charge for each member of the
faction “Sakura Series” anywhere in the field, including herself, she already has a
strong base to make use of her debuffs. However, Kazuradrop can further change her
own class to that of a targeted enemy and gain a huge 75% general <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/strength up.png' width='10' /> Strength Up
against her new class. Her Area-of-Effect damaging <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/quick.png' width='17' /> Quick <a href='#glo_np'>NP</a> inflicts a small
amount of <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/attack down.png' width='10' /> Attack Down, further <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/defense down.png' width='10' /> Defense Down that scales from 20 - 40% with
<a href='#glo_overcharge'>Noble Phantasm Overcharge (Overcharge)</a>, and a 40% chance to <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/stun.png' width='10' /> Stun. Overall,
Kazuradrop (<img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/alter ego.png' width='10' /> Alter Ego) offers good support, especially when dealing damage
alongside another damage dealer but can be awkward to use without <a href='#glo_np'>NP</a> Charge for
allies.

Larva/Tiamat (<img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/archer.png' width='10' /> Archer), expected for release in <a href='#glo_fgo'>Fate Grand Order (FGO)</a> Global in Summer
of 2027, instead concentrates on supporting the Party. 20% <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/quick.png' width='17' /> Quick, 20% <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/arts.png' width='15' /> Arts,
20% <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/attack up.png' width='10' /> Attack Up, 50% <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/critical hit damage.png' width='10' /> Critical Hit Damage, two stages of <a href='#glo_overcharge'>Noble Phantasm
Overcharge (Overcharge)</a>, 8 <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/stars per turn.png' width='10' /> Stars Per Turn for each Party member, 30% <a href='#glo_np'>Noble
Phantasm (NP)</a> Charge, and 10% <a href='#glo_np'>NP</a> Charge Per Turn all for the entire Party is a
tremendous offensive boost. Although her utility is not as broad by comparison, Tiamat
does provide 2000 Party healing and a one-time <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/buff removal resistance.png' width='10' /> Buff Removal Resistance to
interfere with boss gimmicks. What really pushes Larva/Tiamat (<img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/archer.png' width='10' /> Archer) above
other alternatives is her <a href='#glo_np'>NP</a>: a non-damaging Party buff of one turn <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/invincible.png' width='10' /> Invincible,
50% <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/debuff resistance up.png' width='10' /> Debuff Resistance Up, 30% <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/quick.png' width='17' /> Quick Up, 30% <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/arts.png' width='15' /> Arts Up, and 50%
<img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/critical hit damage.png' width='10' /> Critical Hit Damage. Her <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/critical hit damage.png' width='10' /> Critical Hit Damage buff scales with <a href='#glo_overcharge'>Overcharge</a>
for a starting amount of 100%, while all other offensive effects scale with <a href='#glo_np'>NP</a> Levels.
Combined with her skills, the <a href='#glo_np'>NP</a> creates a unique situation where every member of a
Party has a chance to deal significant damage with their cards. Unlike other support
Servants reliant on their <a href='#glo_np'>NP</a>, Tiamat has an additional selfish 20% <a href='#glo_np'>NP</a> Charge to
make her <a href='#glo_np'>NP</a> that much easier to reach the first time. Unfortunately, Tiamat’s own
ability to generate further <a href='#glo_np'>NP</a> Charge with her cards is limited, even after all these
effects. Her boosts to farming are mixed; time is added to each clear with the use of an
additional <a href='#glo_np'>NP</a>, and the <a href='#glo_np'>NP</a> Charge she provides may not enable a <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/quick.png' width='17' /> Quick team as well
as either Scáthach-Skadi’s chunk of 50%. Still, Larva/Tiamat’s (<img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/archer.png' width='10' /> Archer) broad
effects can push any team above and beyond, provided it doesn’t really too much on
<img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/buster.png' width='15' /> Buster.

<!-- l. 324 --><p class='noindent'>Unlike every other Servant in this list, Yui Shōsetsu (<img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/caster.png' width='10' /> Caster) is a four-star. Released as part of
a Limited banner expected for January of 2026 for <a href='#glo_fgo'>Fate Grand Order (FGO)</a> Global, Yui buffs
the entire Party with 30% <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/NP strength up.png' width='10' /> NP Strength Up and 20% <a href='#glo_np'>Noble Phantasm (NP)</a> Charge while
generating 15 <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/stars per turn.png' width='10' /> Stars Per Turn. On top of the Party damage amplification, she adds 30%
<img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/arts.png' width='15' /> Arts Up and <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/critical hit damage.png' width='10' /> Critical Hit Damage for a single target. Yui Shōsetsu’s non-damaging
Party-buffing <a href='#glo_np'>NP</a> heals for 3000 and then literally amplifies all Party Servants based on the color

20%; <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/arts.png' width='15' /> Arts Up receives <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/critical hit damage.png' width='10' /> Critical Hit Damage of 30%; <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/buster.png' width='15' /> Buster Up an
additional 20% <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/NP strength up.png' width='10' /> NP Strength Up. All effects scale with <a href='#glo_np'>NP</a> Levels, except the healing
which scales with <a href='#glo_overcharge'>Noble Phantasm Overcharge (Overcharge)</a>. An additional selfish
30% <a href='#glo_np'>NP</a> Charge ensures the <a href='#glo_np'>NP</a> is easily reached at least once. Astute masters might
notice that since Yui includes a targeted <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/arts.png' width='15' /> Arts Up, her <a href='#glo_np'>NP</a> should always land
<img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/critical hit damage.png' width='10' /> Critical Hit Damage on at least that targeted Servant. However, to best profit from the
<a href='#glo_np'>NP</a> requires Masters select a damage dealer with skills buffing all three color types,
as support Servants included just for these couple effects is usually not worth the
opportunity cost. Astute masters may also notice that Yui Shōsetsu’s (<img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/caster.png' width='10' /> Caster)
capabilities sound very familiar. Indeed, Larva/Tiamat (<img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/archer.png' width='10' /> Archer) is a stronger and
less conditional party support in the majority of cases. Thankfully for Yui, her lower
rarity, significant <img alt='PIC' height='10' src='images/NP strength up.png' width='10' /> NP Strength Up buffs, and some selfish defensive abilities all
differentiate her from her five-star competitor. Yui Shōsetsu is also released over a year
earlier.
